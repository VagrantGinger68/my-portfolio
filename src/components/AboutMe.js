      <p>
        I have always been passionate about technology and how it affects our lives. Web development allows me to create
        applications that can help make people's lives easier. My specialty is front-end development and I have experience
        with the full stack. My preferred stack is React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with Node,
        Express, SQL, and Git.
